## Sorta Actively Working on (but not live yet)

- https://github.com/davidhorm/cookbook - Display and scale ingredient amounts directly in recipe.
- [[react-ui-lib-compare]]

## Took A Couple Steps

- An app to compare two boardgames by looking at BGG ratings from only people that have rated both games.
  - Was thinking about using GitHub Actions to scrape user ratings. https://github.com/davidhorm/bgg-scrape-ratings-action
- An app to help generate an ad for a GeekList auction on [BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/).
  - https://github.com/davidhorm/bgg-auction-ad
- How to do [[Living Documentation]] with tools like Jest, Storybook, and Cypress.

## Shower Thoughts

- Can Cypress and Storybook be used for [[Living Documentation]]?
- What if User Story Mapping was organized Storybook to help with [[Living Documentation]]? Maybe use PlantUML? https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/423
  - Or with own custom plugin. [[TODO - write remark plugins]]
- I want a minimalist capsule wardrobe, but it's hard for me to decide what new article of clothes will go well. What if an app can help me mix and match outfits with SVG?
