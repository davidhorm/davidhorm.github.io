## Sorta Actively Working on (but not live yet)

- https://github.com/davidhorm/cookbook - Display and scale ingredient amounts directly in recipe.
- [[react-ui-lib-compare]]

## Took A Couple Steps

- An app to compare two boardgames by looking at BGG ratings from only people that have rated both games.
  - Was thinking about using GitHub Actions to scrape user ratings. https://github.com/davidhorm/bgg-scrape-ratings-action
- An app to help generate an ad for a GeekList auction on [BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/).

- How to do [[Living Documentation]] with tools like Jest, Storybook, and Cypress.

## Shower Thoughts

- What if User Story Mapping was organized Storybook to help with [[Living Documentation]]? Maybe use PlantUML? https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/423
  - Or with own custom plugin. [[TODO - write remark plugins]]
