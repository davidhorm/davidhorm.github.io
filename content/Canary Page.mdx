The Canary Page is used to help me see all of my designs in one place. The title of the page will be H1 and no other item should be using H1.
For H1, I want [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker?category=Handwriting) font. Maybe 96px? Add a highlighter
shadow effect.

For the body I want [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand?category=Handwriting#standard-styles) because it seems to the
only handwriting style that could work for body text. Prob wanna do 18px font. It also has a 
[small caps](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC) version that would work for emphasis or captions. Maybe at 16px?
[Mali](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali?category=Handwriting#standard-styles) is a close 2nd because it has a lot of weights and styles. There [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat) which is very informal. But
claims to be good for body text and has 4 weights. And a different brush style (that doesn't look any exciting)


[Birthstone Bounce](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Birthstone+Bounce) has two weights, and has a bujo feel to it. There's also 
[Birthstone](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Birthstone) without the bounce, and less playful.

[Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine) reminds me of elvish font.

[Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script) has four weights.
